# NFT SHOPPING WITH BLOCKCHAIN

# Objective

The Objective is to create NFT shopping website backed by blockchain.
<br>

# Overview

The motive is to create a NFT using fungibles such as hair, sunglass etc. to create unique and non-recurring images with token Id embedded inside it to provide uniqueness. The user now creates a blockchain based on the username and file name with username encrypted using SHA-256 encryption which will mine a block and attach the block using previous hash and proof of concept to create a chain of blocks with transaction details in form of block chain.

# Key Features

```
•	Non-Fungible token images created from fungible objects.
•	User can purchase the unique Non fungible token
•	The user gets his block with name and file name stored in encrypted format with the image purchased inside a zip folder.
•	Now the admin of the page executes /get_chain in order to add the block to the blockchain
•	Now blockchain is stored across the globe in various devices (in our cases various files since it cannot be done for free it requires gas fees).
```
