# NFT SHOPPING WITH BLOCKCHAIN

# Objective

The Objective is to create NFT shopping website backed by blockchain.
<br>

# Overview

The motive is to create a NFT using fungibles such as hair, sunglass etc. to create unique and non-recurring images with token Id embedded inside it to provide uniqueness. The user now creates a blockchain based on the username and file name with username encrypted using SHA-256 encryption which will mine a block and attach the block using previous hash and proof of concept to create a chain of blocks with transaction details in form of block chain.
